Welcome!
========

This is my personal blog

I've currently live in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland where I work as python/ django developer at `STX Next <https://stxnext.pl/#/pl>`_.

Besides python development I'm a passionate toastmaster at `Wroclove Speakers <http://www.wroclovespeakers.pl/>`_.
Moreover I am onto running, meeting new people and doing some street workout.

My projects:
============

1. `Histmag to kindle <https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/histmag_to_kindle>`_. Simple web crawler that sends you historical articles to your kindle device.

This blog is using `Clean blog theme <http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/>`_.
